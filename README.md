SETUP
-----
Two API keys are required for the file to work:

- https://openweathermap.org/ (to retrieve local weather data)
- https://ipstack.com/ (to locate user by IP address)

They'll need to be placed in API/API.json.

IPstack should be optional if this is being built/run on a phone, I just don't have a phone to test this on. It should be able to use device's location services to grab the information.


CONTROLS
--------
F11 - Toggle fullscreen.
Mouse for everything else.
